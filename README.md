## Information
Adventurer's Amulets uses the [Baubles API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/baubles), written by [Azanor](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/azanor), to add a bunch of helpful items and utilities that can all be equipped via the Baubles Inventory. All crafting systems in this mod are completely GUI-less, allowing users to spend less time in a GUI and more time in the world.

I started the mod back in 2014 and after leaving in 2015 for a 3 year hiatus it's back and here to stay.
